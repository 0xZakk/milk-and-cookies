# Homework Submission Roolz

All homework assignments will have their own repository, under the `ga-dc` account.

Please **fork** new assignments. Then, **clone** your fork to your computer. Complete your work inside it. Then, **push** your completed work to your forked repository. Finally, make a **pull request** to the upstream repository (in `ga-dc`).
