#### `if` statements

**Bouncer**

* Define the following variables
  * `age` : number
* If your age is greater than 21, print "Welcome."
* If your age is less than 21 but greater than 18, print "Come in, but here's a wristband."
* If your age is less than 18, print "Nice try, you've still got x years to go.", where x is how many years you have till you become 18.

**Air conditioning**

* Define the following variables
  * `threshold` : number, 70
  * `temperature` : number
  * `acWorking` : boolean
* Use `if` statements to implement the following behavior
  * If the temperature is greater than the threshold and the AC is working, print "Turn on the AC!"
  * If the temperature is greater than the threshold and the AC is not working, print "Fix the AC! It's hot!"
  * If the temperature is less than the threshold and the AC is working, print "Ah, maxin' relaxin'."
  * If the temperature is less than the threshold and the AC is not working, print "When you get the chance, fix the AC."

#### `for` loops

**Array iteration**

* Define the following variables
  * `myFavoriteNumbers` : array of some numbers
* Iterate through an array and print for each element the message "The element at position x is y.", where x is the index and y is the value of the element
* `someArray.length` will give you the number of elements in an array

**More array iteration**

* Define the following variables
  * `arr1` and `arr2` : arrays of numbers of the same length
* Go through the elements of the arrays and print for each element the message:
  * "Greater" if the element in `arr1` is greater than the corresponding element in `arr2`
  * "Less" if the element in `arr1` is less than the corresponding element in `arr2`
  * "Equal" if the element in `arr1` is equal the corresponding element in `arr2`
