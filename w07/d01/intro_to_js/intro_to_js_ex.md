## FizzBuzz a la JS

Create a JS program
- this program should use a loop
- it will count from 1 to 1000
  - if the number is divisible by 3 it will print `fizz` instead of the number
  - if the number is divisible by 5 it will print `buzz` instead of the number
  - if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it will print `fizzbuzz` instead of the number
