# Functions in JavaScript

## Learning Objectives

- Define what a function is in Javascript and how it compares to a Ruby method
- Describe how function arguments and return values are different from Ruby
- Differentiate between function declarations and expressions
- Define `hoisting`
- Define a closure in the context of programming

## Outline

### Defining and calling methods

**I do**

* Different ways to define a function
  * var func = function(a, b) {};
  * function func(a,b) {};
* Loose input arguments
* Explicit returns

**You do**

* Write a function to accept three numbers and return their product.
* Write a function to accept an age and returns
  * true if you can rent a car without additional fees
  * false if you cannot rent a car without additional fees
* Write a function to accept an array and print the elements in order

**I do**

* What is hoisting?
* Demonstrate loose arguments
  * Extra arguments are ignored
  * Undefined arguments are undefined
* Difference between parentheses and no parentheses
  * Referring to a function vs...
  * Calling a function

### Scope

Demonstrate how functions have access to variables in the scope they were defined.

Demonstrate how we can pass a function in as an argument.
