## A New Start

In this exercise, we'll identify things from the first half of WDI that we liked and/or
would do differently. Please pair up and list:

- things you would do differently
- one thing you wish you could have done in the last 6 weeks
- one thing you would like to accomplish in the next 6 weeks
