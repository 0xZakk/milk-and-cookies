In order to prepare for Thursday, you will create a portfolio page that incorporates Sass and Responsive Web Design.

## Goals

- Use at least two media queries to change styles at different viewport sizes.
  - Need an idea? Check out <http://thisisresponsive.com/>
- Use sass to compile and minify your stylesheets.
  - Replace repeated values with variables (hex values, font families, etc..)
  - Nest at least one selector to organize your styles.
  - Use at least one `@extend` or `@include`.
