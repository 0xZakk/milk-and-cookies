# W08D02 Homework

To begin with, complete the steps in the `ajax` branch of the Stock Tracker repo:

https://github.com/ga-dc/stock-tracker/tree/ajax

(Hint: `git pull origin ajax` into a new branch.)

## Then...

Pull down the `solution` branch of the Trillo repo, made by Jesse:

https://github.com/ga-dc/trillo/tree/solution

Walk through all of the Javascript in Jesse's code and add in comments saying **in plain English** what each portion does.

## Finally...

Submit both the stock tracker and your Trillo comments as pull requests.
