## Let's get retro
- Everyone knows that hipster chic is what it's all about right now.
- A key aspect of tapping this market is to shun our modern technology and go back to a simpler time.
- The way we are going to achieve this is by making a command line PDA (because hipsters are always on their MacBooks -- but only ironically).

## Specs

- First and foremost we want to bring in the functionality of our temperature converter.
- Feel free to copy your code from the in class exercise into this app.

- Next, we know we will be adding new features and functionalities to our PDA, so it would make sense to have a menu to present to the user to allow them to make choices.
- We'll start simply...
  - *A user should be able to see a menu offering multiple option.*
  - Something like:
    ```
    Enter 1 for a nice greeting!
    Enter 2 to convert a temperature.
    Enter 3 to see your personal information.
    etc...
    ```
---
- *When a user enters '1' they should be greeted however you like.*
- *When a user enters '2' they should be prompted for a temp, starting format, and ending format.*
- *When a user enters '3' their 'hard-coded' personal information should be displayed in a legible format.*
- *When a user enters 'Q' the program should exit.*
- *After each option is selected and the corresponding action is completed, the user should again be prompted with the menu so they continue in the program until choosing 'Q'.*
- *When a user enters '4' they should be given an option to help them decide if they need to turn on their heater or AC unit.*
    - Ask the user what the current temperature is, if the A/C is functional, and what temperature they wish it was.
    - If the AC is functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Turn on the AC Please"
    - If the AC is non-functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Fix the AC now! It's hot!"
    - If the AC is non-functional and the current temperature is below the the desired temperature... display "Fix the AC whenever you have the chance... It's cool..."

## __BONUS__
- __PLEASE NOTE: This is a stretch goal if you are able to complete all the other specification, it is not required or expected.__
- Add any other functionality you think would be cool (calculator, to-do list, whateva!)
