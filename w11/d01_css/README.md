# W11D01: Digital Product Design

## Intro

- The biggest "suck" about being a developer
  - Even if your product has the most amazing functionality ever, ultimately how it *looks* and not how it works will create the all-important first impression.
  - In most cases, a non-functional product that looks really slick is "better" than a functioning product that looks like poo.

- The double-edged sword of design
  - Everyone's opinion of design is just as valid as everyone else's opinion.
  - If Joe the Plumber thinks your interface is ugly, he won't use your product.

- The popularity of Bootstrap
  - Developers hate on Bootstrap because "everything looks like Bootstrap"
  - Joe the Plumber probably doesn't care; just sees a slick-looking interface
  - ...but we're going to leave it to you to figure out Bootstrap
    - You pretty much just link to it and it goes to work

## Easy wins

What can you quickly and easily do to your web product that will make it look compelling?

### Brainstorm (15 minutes)

With your table, compile a list of 3 websites whose interfaces you like. On the whiteboard, write down the design aspects they have in common.

Things to consider:
  - Widths of elements relative other elements
  - Fonts
  - Color schemes
  - Border styles and radii
  - Animations
